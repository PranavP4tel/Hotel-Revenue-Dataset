# Hotel-Revenue-Dataset

Explored hotel revenue dataset containing data across 2018,2019 & 2020 to analyze factors of importance and derive insights.
Utilized aggregation functions, group bys, joins and more, to conduct assessments in SQL, such as:
1. Total Revenue generated with and without the discount, with and without factoring in meal cost, broken down by hotel type
2. Revenue broken down across countries and hotel type.
3. Total check-ins based on months and based on day of the month, to derive peak hotel booking periods
4. Inspecting market segments to derive percent of bookings conducted via an online travel agent/office.
5. Preferred room type and meal type by the guests.

Imported data from MySQL Server to PowerBI, with an additional query to merge the tables resulting in a singular dataset for easy visualization.
Created measures to derive total bookings, total revenue, total parking and online booking percent.

Created a dashboard containing elements:
1. Cards to emphasize total revenue, average ADR and average discount, total booking and booking percentage made via an online ta/to 
2. Revenue visualized over the months, broken down by hotel type, via a line graph
3. Parking requirement assessment conducted in tabular format
4. Analyzing preferred meal as per room type via a clustered chart
5. Finally, created slicers to filter data based on selected time period, hotel type and country
